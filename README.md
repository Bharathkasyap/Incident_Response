## üß† What is Incident Response (IR)?

**Incident Response (IR)** is a structured set of procedures for identifying, managing, and recovering from security incidents. IR minimizes damage, reduces recovery time and costs, and helps organizations comply with regulations.

---

## üéØ Why Incident Response Matters

- Prevents data breaches and minimizes downtime
- Ensures rapid containment of threats
- Helps comply with standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Increases customer and stakeholder trust

---

## üîÑ Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST SP 800-61)

| Phase             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preparation**       | Planning, policies, tools, roles, and playbooks setup                     |
| **Detection & Analysis** | Identifying indicators of compromise and validating the incident         |
| **Containment, Eradication & Recovery** | Stop spread, remove threat, restore to safe state              |
| **Post-Incident Activity** | Debriefing, documentation, updates to policy & infrastructure         |

---

## üß© Detailed Lifecycle Phases Explained

### 1. **Preparation**
- Define policies, scope, incident types
- Set up monitoring (EDR, SIEM, IDS/IPS)
- Conduct table-top exercises
- Train SOC teams
- Set logging and retention standards

### 2. **Detection & Analysis**
- Use alerts/logs from MDE, SIEM, firewall, antivirus
- Identify anomalies and validate against known IOCs
- Triage and classify incident (severity & scope)
- Determine affected users, assets, data

### 3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**
- Short-term: isolate device/network segment
- Long-term: deploy patches, reset credentials
- Eradicate persistence (scripts, registry, accounts)
- Recover via backup restore or gold image deployment

### 4. **Post-Incident Activity**
- Conduct lessons-learned review with all teams
- Update detection rules and playbooks
- Notify stakeholders
- Improve logging or control gaps
